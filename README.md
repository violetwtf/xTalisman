# Commission I didn't get paid for
Same network as xTabList, much more complicated project. I was still using instancing at the time.
Support is not provided. It will not build due to the private maven repository that was used.

Changes:
* All instances of their package name changed to `wtf.violet`
* All instances of their name removed
* All instances of their website removed

Feel free to explore.
